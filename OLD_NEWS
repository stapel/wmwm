User visible changes

2012-03-05

  * New key: MODKEY + i hides windows.

  * New program: hidden. Lists hidden windows.

2012-02-15

  * Added option -i to allow icons.

  * Added scripts: mcmenu (configurable start meny) and 9icon (to map
    iconified windows).

2012-02-07

  * Check for socket errors. Should prevent busy loops.

2011-11-22

  * Now optionally starts programs when MODKEY + mouse buttons are
    pressed on root window. See config.h for configuration and the
    manual page for an example.

    Also simplified starting programs.

2011-11-17

  * In a ConfigureRequest we no longer obey window movements not
    initiated by the user.

  * Fixed bug where client-initiated resize could resize outside of
    physical screen.

  * Fixed bug with topright command on other physical screens.

  * -b no longer boolean. Now takes parameter number of pixels.

2011-08-15

  * Fixed crash in one screen scenario.

  * Fixed non-starting bug when on an architecture with unsigned
    chars.

2011-08-12

  * It was still possible to map a window on coordinates outside
    physical screens. Now hopefully fixed, if not perfectly: If a
    window isn't bound to any physical screen it will be mapped on the
    first screen mcwm knows about.

2011-07-26

  * Tabbing warps to middle of window instead of corner. Makes it
    easier if you want to paste something with middle button without
    having to move the pointer.

2011-07-20

   * Speedup when using a trackball or high CPI mouse. Use only mouse
     pointer hints instead of actual mouse events and let mcwm ask for
     pointer position.

     Incidentally, this was originally added in June, 2010, but
     removed a month later after reading Gajewska and Manasse's "Why X
     Is Not Our Ideal Window System". Real experience shows that I was
     mistaken.

2011-06-20

   * Fixed windows were always inserted as the next window in window
     list after changing workspace. Now fixed.

2011-06-01

   * Beginning of RANDR support. mcwm now aware of the number of
     physical screens and their sizes. Move and resize is now limited
     by size of physical screen instead of virtual screen.

   * New keys: Mod4 + , moves focused window to previous screen and
     Mod4 + . moves it to the next screen.

2011-03-29

   * Panels and other windows with window manager override interfered
     with resize. mcwm got confused about the size of the window. Now
     fixed.

2011-03-28

   * Always raise window when fixing it on all workspaces. When moving
     windows between workspaces, this makes us sure we can find it on
     the workspace we're going to. Thanks to Simon Friis for noticing.

2011-03-26

   * You don't have to tell mcwm what keycode generates the MODKEY
     mask anymore (USERKEY_MOD in config.h is gone). mcwm now asks the
     X server what keys generate the mask and also supports several
     keys generating the mask.

   * Stops tabbing around not only if a key generating MODKEY mask is
     lifted but also if another command key is pressed.

2011-03-18

   * Now handles keyboard remapping.

2011-02-23

   * If you change focus window mcwm remembers where we last had
     focus. If you start using MODKEY+Tab to move around the window
     list the first Tab will always bring you to where we last had
     focus.

2011-02-19

   * Resets per window state of max or vertical max when physical
     screen size changes.

   * Doesn't reset x coordinate when unmaxing vertically.

   * Specifically grab the keycodes we use and keycodes + shift
     modifier. Now works OK with xbindkeys.

2010-11-18

   NOTA BENE! Modifier key changed! Now using Mod4 instead of Mod2 for
   key bindnings. I've been using my own key maps for so long that I
   forgot all about NumLock usually being Mod2 and users complained.
   I'm sorry.

2010-11-01

  * Fixed bug. We mangled a list when a window was destroyed on
    another workspace. This would lead to sticky windows that we
    didn't seem to know about. 

    The same code also prepares for the possibility that a window
    might occupy several, but not all, workspaces at the same time. We
    still don't have any user interface to control this, however.

2010-09-08

  * New key: MODKEY + End closes window. Patch from Christian
    Neukirchen, who used MODKEY + ESC instead.

2010-08-23

  * Obey window coordinates when doing initial mapping if the client
    says the user specified them, for instance with a -geometry.

2010-08-10

  * Mod2-Tab no longer raises a window unless it's necessary for the
    window to be visible.

  * We no longer obey clients trying to map themselves on the current
    workspace when they belong to another workspace. Notably, this
    affects Emacs frames used with emacsclient if server-raise-frame
    is non-nil. The mouse pointer will still be warped, though, but at
    least we stop the window on the other workspace to suddenly move
    to the current workspace.

2010-07-28

  * Now works with unclutter.

2010-07-23

  * Better use of size increments.

2010-07-22

  * When resizing by keyboard we don't warp the pointer along with the
    window if the pointer was outside the window when we started
    resizing.

2010-07-21-2

  * When moving by keyboard, we don't warp the pointer along with the
    window if the pointer was outside the window to begin with.

  * Don't allow moving or resizing of fully maximized windows.

2010-07-21

  * Will react on signals directly instead of waiting for next X event.

  * Raises windows before moving to corner.

2010-07-20

  * Grabbed keypresses that mcwm doesn't know what to do with will be
    sent to the focused window.

  * More bug fixes.

2010-07-19-2

  * Many bug fixes. Including crashing bugs, triggered under Linux.

2010-07-18

  * Move and resize, both with keyboard and mouse, now keeps pointer
    in place within window if it's possible without losing focus.

  * Move window to screen corners with YUBN.

2010-07-10

  * Border colour of fixed windows can be set from command line with
    -x colour.

  * Dies gracefully and maps all windows on all workspaces.

  * Handle unmapped, but inactive, windows when changing workspaces.
    This means that xpdf's and gv's transient windows won't show up
    again when changing workspaces unless they're currently really
    active.

2010-07-07

  * Rearranges windows to be visible and fit on screen if a physical
    screen is removed or screen is tilted.

  * Maximize and vertical maximize toggles.

  * First virtual workspace, that is 1, is now numbered as 0 in the
    _NET_WM_DESKTOP as in the rest of the window managers following
    EWMH.

2010-06-30

  * Virtual workspaces available with Mod2-0,1,2... Fix on all
    workspaces with Mod2-f.

2010-06-29

  * Focus can change from keyboard with Mod2-Tab.

2010-06-24-3

  * -f and -u options for focused and unfocused colours.

2010-06-24

  * When starting, we don't care about windows with override redirect
    set. This means, for instance, that if a GTK application was
    running when we started, we won't draw any borders around its
    menus.

  * New option, -t <terminal-program>.

  * Fixed bugs.

2010-06-22

  * Handles size changes of the root window. That is, if the user adds
    an additional screen or removes one when the X server supports
    RANDR.

  * MODKEY + R toggles raise/lower of window.

  * Maps new windows on pointer position and tries to fit on screen.

  * Resizes with size hints. This means, for instance, that most
    programs using fixed width fonts resizes by font width and height.
    No feedback yet, though.

  * Handles more requests, which means usable with more programs
    (xterm and xpdf, for instance, which hardly worked before).

  * Fixed bugs.
  
2010-06-19

  * Now a real window manager. Now controls mapping of windows. If we
    can't be a real window manager, this probably means there is
    already one running, so we fall back to co-running.

    Windows are mapped at the pointer position if we can control it.

  * A flag, -b, for not drawing any borders what so ever. Might be
    useful when co-running.

  * Now doesn't raise windows all the time while moving or resizing
    with the mouse. Just raises once.
