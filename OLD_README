This is a window manager for the X Window System written entirely with
XCB, the straight X protocol binding to the C language. It doesn't use
libX11 at all.

mcwm is a rather minimalist, floating window manager. The only window
decoration is a thin border. All functions can be done with the
keyboard, but moving, resizing, raising and lowering can also be done
with the mouse.

If you don't like the default key bindings, border width, et cetera,
look in the config.h file, change and recompile.

See the manual page for how to use it.

== Compiling ==

As distributed mcwm compiles fine under FreeBSD. If you want to
compile mcwm under Debian-derived GNU/Linux systems you will need
these packages and their dependencies: libxcb1-dev, libxcb-atom1-dev,
libxcb-keysyms1-dev, libxcb-icccm1-dev, libxcb-randr0-dev.

Other system are likely to have similar requirements.
