TODO
-------------------

Supported:
_NET_WM_FULL_PLACEMENT (for


 * Merge Containers
 *! Make wtree functions use client_t to hide tree stuff?
 * "optimal" tiling-mode, based on height/width
 * update_geometry -> update_geometry + actually_set_geometry ?
 * handled window list for EWMH
 * save geometry from before tiling?
 * move floating, fullscreen test from raise/lower to before 


OLD TODO
 * I could remove the prev pointer..
 * Key handling
 * client list atom in root window: all windows or workdesk?
 * checks for NULL in list and tree handling is unsatisfying
 * !overflow/underflow in geometry.x += -= etc.
 * DIRTY state for when screen resolution changes for other workspaces?
   or make checks on position/size on each workspace switch?
 * ALT+TAB goes rewind after letting go and repeat
 * respect workarea (e.g. title bar)?
 * mouse raise/lower does not allways work when I keep clicking
 * jdownloader2 seems to fuck up focus
 * retroarch looses focus on quit
 * size hints are minus border etc, maybe check for others as well
 * size hints position and size are obsolete
 * better handling of atoms (ewmh,icccm) and their usage
   (cut xcb_ewmh ext?)
 * !XXX user/program specified size
 * inactive border color (allow to choose and/or dim inactive from active)
 * !set CLASS and PID for Window Manager
 * maybe change TAB change order (orig was different)
 * !race condition on workspace-switch? (mapping/focus)
   -> ? (maybe not race, sometimes mpv doesn't get focus when spawned
         via firefox)
   -> Yes, change that hidden_events stuff! TODO
 * different color for windows that cannot have inputfocus ?
 * color: use logic ops for "graying/darken" "normal" colors
 * startup:
 * 	focus (would have to switch ws to make everything work fine)
 * 	windows get moved some pixels ?
 * Override-Redirect Windows ? (dock etc.)
 	what about them going off-screen?
 * gprof/gcov?
 * focuswin/lastfocuswin (remove that last- somehow)
 * !only update geometry after workspace change (or on current) after
   monitor-updates
 * setup keys for single keys (mapping_notify)
 * !set_focus/set_focus_win
 * !stacking
 * !_NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW
 * handle_client_message more
 * MWM hints
 * aspect normal_hints
 * !Error handling
 * ?LVDS is seen as clone of VGA-0? look at special-log
 * NET_WM_STATE client message
 * configurewin (don't like that somehow)
 * key handling, automate a little further, it looks really ugly
 * maximize to v/h not fullscreen - only use fullscreen via hint from app
 * register events for client? (so keep client struct for window?)
 * synthetic unmap notify handling
 * initial atoms (esp. _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN etc.)
 * encapsulate geometry?
 * hide() is now used generally, remove allow_icons stuff
 * unparent clients, remove atoms ... on quit
 * WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS ?
 * for client messages I might check for source type:
	if (e->data.data32[1] == XCB_EWMH_CLIENT_SOURCE_TYPE_OTHER
		|| e->data.data32[1] == XCB_EWMH_CLIENT_SOURCE_TYPE_NONE)
