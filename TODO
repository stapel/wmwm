TODO
-------------------

 * !overflow/underflow in geometry.x += -= etc.
 * DIRTY state for when screen resolution changes for other workspaces?
   or make checks on position/size on each workspace switch?
 * ALT+TAB goes rewind after letting go and repeat
 * respect workarea (e.g. title bar)?
 * mouse raise/lower does not allways work when I keep clicking
 * jdownloader2 seems to fuck up focus
 * dialog positioning (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG etc)
 * (if wmwm starts? and) something is fullscreen, maybe use hints for
   unfullscreen state
 * retroarch looses focus on quit
 * size hints are minus border etc, maybe check for others as well
 * size hints position and size are obsolete
 * better handling of atoms (ewmh,icccm) and their usage
   (cut xcb_ewmh ext?)
 * !XXX user/program specified size
 * !clients when WM restarts?
 * !I had 20T VM usage? (probably Xorg-bug)
 * !it happened once that I could not toggle between all visible windows
 * inactive border color (allow to choose and/or dim inactive from active)
 * allow old MODKEY functionality (e.g. windows-key instead of ALT+CTRL)
 * !CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+NUMBER sends focuswin to workspace NUMBER?
 * !set CLASS and PID for Window Manager
 * maybe change TAB change order (orig was different)
 * !race condition on workspace-switch? (mapping/focus)
   -> ? (maybe not race, sometimes mpv doesn't get focus when spawned
         via firefox)
   -> Yes, change that hidden_events stuff! TODO
 * different color for windows that cannot have inputfocus ?
 * color: use logic ops for "graying/darken" "normal" colors
 * startup:
 * 	focus (would have to switch ws to make everything work fine)
 * 	windows get moved some pixels ?
 * Override-Redirect Windows ? (dock etc.)
 	what about them going off-screen?
 * gprof/gcov?
 * focuswin/lastfocuswin (remove that last- somehow)
 * !only update geometry after workspace change (or on current) after
   monitor-updates
 * setup keys for single keys (mapping_notify)
 * !set_focus/set_focus_win
 * !stacking
 * !_NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW
 * handle_client_message more
 * MWM hints
 * aspect normal_hints
 * !Error handling
 * ?LVDS is seen as clone of VGA-0? look at special-log
 * NET_WM_STATE client message
 * configurewin (don't like that somehow)
 * key handling, automate a little further, it looks really ugly
 * maximize to v/h not fullscreen - only use fullscreen via hint from app
 * register events for client? (so keep client struct for window?)
 * synthetic unmap notify handling
 * initial atoms (esp. _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN etc.)
 * encapsulate geometry?
 * hide() is now used generally, remove allow_icons stuff
 * unparent clients, remove atoms ... on quit
 * WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS ?
 * for client messages I might check for source type:
	if (e->data.data32[1] == XCB_EWMH_CLIENT_SOURCE_TYPE_OTHER
		|| e->data.data32[1] == XCB_EWMH_CLIENT_SOURCE_TYPE_NONE)
